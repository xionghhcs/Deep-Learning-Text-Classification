## Datasets

### Overview

|Dataset| Introduction|
|---|---|
|IDBM|       |
|AG News|    |


### IMDB

This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided. See the README file contained in the release for more details.

### rt-polarity 

This dataset is a sentence level movie review dataset which consist of 5331 positive sentences and 5331 negivate sentences. It was introduced in Pang/Lee ACL 2005. Released July 2005.

### DBpedia ontology

40,000 training samples and 5,000 testing samples from 14 nonoverlapping classes from DBpedia 2014. For each class, there are 40,000 training samples and 5,000 testing samples.


### AG News

AG News is a news articles dataset which collected from more than 2000 news sources.This dataset has  4 classes and only the title and description fields are used.The number of training samples for each class is 30,000 and testing 1900.

I download this dataset from fast.ai for my experiemnt.
